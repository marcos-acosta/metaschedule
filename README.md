# Metaschedule

### What is it?
An online web app for students who want to consider multiple possible schedules based on desired courses and section preferences :)

### Where is it?

[Right here!](https://metaschedule.netlify.app/)

### How do I use it?
1. Search for and add any courses you're planning on taking in the 'course search' panel
2. Add any section filters you'd like in the 'schedules' panel
3. Click the 'generate schedules' button and that's it!

### How does it work?
Metaschedule fetches live course data from Hyperschedule's API service at [this link](https://hyperschedule.herokuapp.com/api/v3/courses?school=hmc) (thanks Hyperschedule!) and the rest is javascript.

### Can I suggest changes?
Yes! This GitHub page is open to everyone, so feel free to fork and make push requests, add issues, suggestions, or contact me directly :)
